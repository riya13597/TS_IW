									<h5 class="text-green" data-ques="697"><strong>How often can I remove my money?</strong></h5>
									<div class="answer answer_697"><p>An investor has no restriction on redeeming money from an open ended scheme. While there may be an exit load in certain cases, which impacts final amount realised, all open end schemes offer liquidity as a great benefit. </p>
<p>The decision to redeem is totally at investor's discretion. There are no restrictions on the number of redemptions, or on the amount to be redeemed. There have to be sufficient units in the account to fund redemptions. Scheme documents usually indicate minimum amount that can be redeemed. </p>
<p>Units under lien to a bank or institution cannot be redeemed, unless the lien is removed. Redemptions may be restricted only under extraordinary circumstances, as decided by the Board of Trustees. </p>

<p>Closed end schemes may be redeemed from the AMC only on maturity. However, they do provide a route to liquidity-anytime before maturity-by selling units in a recognised exchange.
Redemptions can be made at;</p>
<p>1)Investor Service Centres (ISCs) </p>
<p>2)AMC offices </p>
<p>3)official Points of Acceptance of Transaction (OPAT) </p>
<p>4)Through an authorised on-line platform.</p>

									<h5 class="text-green" data-ques="930"><strong>How much of my investment can I withdraw? </strong></h5>
									<div class="answer answer_930"><p>Majority of Mutual Fund schemes are open end schemes, which allow an investor to redeem the entire invested amount without any time restrictions. </p>
<p>Only under few instances schemes impose a restriction on redemption, under extraordinary circumstances, as decided by the Board of Trustees. </p>
<p>All Equity Linked Savings Schemes (ELSS), that offer tax benefits under Sec 80C, are required to 'lock-in' investments for a period of 3 years. However, any dividend declared by these schemes during this period is available as a pay out without restrictions. No other category of schemes can impose such a lock-in. Some may impose an exit-load for premature redemptions, to prevent short term investments from entering a scheme. AMCs may specify minimum amounts that may be submitted. All such information is contained in scheme related documents which is important for an investor to read before investing.
</p>Closed end schemes have a fixed tenure and the AMC does not fund or permit any redemption until termination/conclusion date. However, all closed end funds have their units listed in the stock exchange and an investor seeking Ilquidity needs to sell units to another buyer at a market determined rate.

									<h5 class="text-green" data-ques="931"><strong>.Can I remove money on all days or only on particular days? </strong></h5>
									<div class="answer answer_931"><p>An open end fund permits redemptions on all business days. If a redemption request is handed over at an Investor Service Centre on a non-business day, or after a specified cut-off time, say 3:00 P.m., then it is processed on the next business day. Redemptions are processed at that particular day's Net Asset Value (NAV) All redemption proceeds are credited to the investor's bank account within a specified time, usually within 10 business days. </p><p>

Redemptions may be done by handing over a signed redemption request clearly mentioning the scheme's folio number. Redemptions may also be made on approved on-line platforms, where investors have the necessary security codes.</p>
<p>Investments made in Equity Linked Savings Schemes (ELSS), however have a lock-in of 3 years, after which they can be redeemed on any business day.</p>
<p>Redemptions may be restricted only in extraordinary circumstances. Under approval from the board of trustees, the AMC may impose restrictions when there is a liquidity issue, capital market closure, operational crisis or when directed by SEBI. It is important to note that these occurrences are extremely rare.</p>

									<h5 class="text-green" data-ques="694"><strong>Are there penalties if I choose to withdraw earlier? </strong></h5>
									<div class="answer answer_694"><p>Every open ended scheme offers liquidity with almost complete freedom, I.e. No restriction on time or amount of redemption. However, a few schemes may specify an Exit Load. </p>
<p>	For example, a scheme specifies an exit load of 1%, if redeemed within 1 year. What it means is that, if an investor has invested on Apri11,2016, any redemption done on or before March 31,2017 would attract a penalty of 1% on the NAV. 1f an investor redeems on February 1,2017 with the NAV at 200, then 12 would be deducted and only 198 per unit would be returned to investor. </p>
<p>All information on exit loads are usually mentioned in relevant scheme related documents. For instance, a fund fact sheet or key information memorandum would contain such information.</p>

									<h5 class="text-green" data-ques="611"><strong>Why should one invest in Mutual Funds?</strong></h5>
									<div class="answer answer_611">One should never invest in Mutual Funds, but should invest through them.

<p>To elaborate, we invest in various investment avenues based on our requirements, e.g. For capital growth-we invest in equity shares, for safety of capital and regular income-we buy
fixed income products.</p>

<p>The concern for most investors is: how to know which instruments are best for them? one may
not have enough abilities, time or interest to conduct the research.
To manage investments, one can outsource certain tasks one is unable to do. Anyone can
outsource 'managing one's investments' to a professional firm-the Mutual Fund company.
Mutual Funds offer various avenues to fulfill different objectives, which investors can
choose from based on one's unique situation and objective.</p>

<p>Mutual Fund companies manage all administrative activities including paperwork. They also facilitate accounting and reporting the progress of the investment portfolios through a combination of Net Asset Values (NAVs) and the account statements.
</p>
<p>Mutual Fund is a great convenience for those who need to invest their money for future requirements. A team of professionals manages the money and the investors can enjoy the fruits of this expertise without getting involved in the mundane tasks.

									<h5 class="text-green" data-ques="609"><strong>Can I invest now, for my vacation 8 months later? </strong></h5>
									<div class="answer answer_609">Articles about Mutual Funds are usually written for planning to achieve certain long term specific goals, and investors assume that other goals, especially short term cannot be achieved.
Let us break this myth with an example.

<p>Ramesh, a travel junkie got to satisfy his wanderlust, when the company he worked for achieved success and rewarded its employees with bonuses. </p>

<p>With his bonus Ramesh decided to go on a Europe trip, but his work on a big and prestigious project was incomplete and approaching its deadline. The project would end in the next eight months.
</p>
<p>The exact date of Ramesh's trip is yet to be finalized. Looking at his expenses-some money
needs to be spent before and some during the trip. Uncertainty regarding the exact dates on
which how much money is to be paid is there.
</p>
<p>Certain Mutual Fund schemes are ideal for such cases.
Ideally Ramesh should park these savings into a liquid fund to take them out on any working
day. Money will be in his account the day after he submits a request for withdrawal. Ramesh
can even request for withdrawal through an SMS or App.
</p>
<p>Planning for even short term goals becomes convenient with this.

								<div class="panel-body faq-content question question_610 panel-body pannel_561" data-id="610" data-cat="561">
									<h5 class="text-green" data-ques="610"><strong>What age should one start investing? </strong></h5>
									<div class="answer answer_610"><p>Rahim and Suresh moved to Mumbai as opportunities to earn and spend were higher.
Suresh looked at the income opportunity and decided to enjoy life. Rahim, on the other hand, decided to save and invest his earning, in order to survive in the city.
</p>
<p>Rahim was concerned when he learnt about Suresh's lifestyle and tried explaining him the benefits of saving young with numbers.
Rahim had started investing at the age of 25. He was investing ₹ 5,000 per month and earned @10% P.a. on his investments. In all, he would invest ₹21 lacs and accumulate a sum of ₹1.70 crores at 60 years of age.
</p>
<p>If Suresh started investing ₹ 30,000 per month even at the age of 46, his total investment over the years would be ₹ 54 lacs. Earning@10% per year on his investments, he would accumulate less than ₹1.2 crores when he's 60.
</p>
<p>Although Suresh invested ₹ 54 lacs as against Rahim's ₹ 21 lacs and both earned at the same rate of return, Rahim would accumulate a larger sum due to the time he gave to his investments. Starting early started the magic, and the power of compounding did the rest.

									<h5 class="text-green" data-ques="608"><strong>How popular are Mutual Funds in other countries? </strong></h5>
									<div class="answer answer_608"><p>The Global Assets Under Management (AUM) of open-end Mutual Fund schemes exceeded US$37.1 trillion, across 100,494 schemes as on Dec 31,2015.
While developed markets have the maximum AUM, developing or emerging markets are beginning to break out. The US had over $17.7 trillion in AUM, while Europe had $12.7 trillion. Asia Pacific countries had $4.7 trillion, of which Australia, China and Japan accounted for $1.52 Trillion, $1.26 Trillion and $1.33 Trillion respectively. Brazil, had over $743 Billion in Mutual Fund Assets. India had Assets of $168 Billion, thus showing the low penetration of Mutual Funds in India, while highlighting the tremendous unrealised potential in India. </p>

<p>The data suggests that Mutual Funds are very popular in developed nations and are rapidly creating acceptance in fast growing emerging markets. Aiding the growth is increase in GDP as well as establishment of effective regulatory structures to manage the growth.

									<h5 class="text-green" data-ques="606"><strong>How diverse is the acceptance of Mutual Funds in India? </strong></h5>
									<div class="answer answer_606"><p>After its launch in 1964, Mutual Funds have grown to manage assets over 17.37 lakh crores
(as on Jan 31,2017). </p>

<p>This impressive growth is because of a strong Indian economy, better regulation, entry of  reputed Indian and Foreign Asset Managers, and increasing acceptance of Mutual Funds as a
preferred asset class amongst Indian investors. </p>
<p>
It is interesting to note that the average investment in every individual retail investor account
is 68,086, indicating the acceptance of this asset class by the growing Indian middle class.</p>

<p>India today has 42 Asset Management Companies (AMC) that help increase awareness and aid in spreading the message of Mutual Funds and financial planning to an increasingly aspirational country.
</p>
<p>Nearly 4000 crores is invested every month by way of Systematic Investment Plans, another
indicator of the trust and popularity of Mutual Funds in India.
</p>
<p>The Top 15 cities of India have 83% of total Mutual Fund Assets. The industry is making serious efforts to broaden the awareness and acceptance of Mutual Funds in smaller cities and towns of India.

									<h5 class="text-green" data-ques="603"><strong>Have Mutual Funds been around for a long time? </strong></h5>
									<div class="answer answer_603"><p>Collective and pooled investments have existed in various traditional formats across the world for some time. Mutual Fund as we know it came into existence in 1924, with creation of Massachusetts Investors Trust. </p>
<p>The Mutual Fund industry growth was accompanied by three broad trends:
</p>
<p>
Stricter regulation-Ensures investor protection and proper supervision of fund management

<p>
Stricter regulation-Ensures investor protection and proper supervision of fund management
industry. </p>
<p>Introduction of more innovative products- Which suits the needs of different customers; from long term retirement planning to short term cash management.
Mutual Funds have been in existence in India, since Unit Trust of India (UTI) established in 1963. UTI was set up by Government of India and Reserve Bank of India. Unit Scheme 64, launched in 1964 was the first Mutual Fund scheme.
In 1987, other public sector banks and institutions were permitted to launch Mutual Funds. In 1993, following a wave of liberalization, the private sector and foreign sponsors were allowed to launch Mutual Funds.
This ensured that the Mutual Fund Industry rapidly acquired size, expertise and reach. As on Dec 31, 2016, Mutual Funds in India managed assets exceeding 16.93 lac crores.

									<h5 class="text-green" data-ques="602"><strong>Is there an advantage in investing in funds with an exit load? </strong></h5>
									<div class="answer answer_602"><p>Let consider a Balanced Fund, which aims to provide growth and capital appreciation from the equity portion, and income and stability from the debt portion. This scheme still carries considerable risk, as the portion of equity could be as high as 75%. This is recommended only for investors with a healthy risk appetite and long term time horizon.
The fund management team of such a scheme would ideally want only long term investors who share their conviction of staying invested for a long period, of a minimum of 3 years. Thus the fund may impose an exit load of 1 % for all redemptions done before 3 years. In such a case, the fund is not impacting liquidity directly, but is discouraging investors from exiting before a period of 3 years.</p>
<p>The advantage for the scheme would stem from the fact that all investors are aligned to a longer time horizon. This would be a comforting factor for the fund manager, enabling him to pick securities with such a thought in mind. In the fund manager's view such a strategy  would enable better fund performance, as there would be no short term investors and redemptions impacting a long term strategy.

									<h5 class="text-green" data-ques="601"><strong>Are there funds that need me to stay invested for a stipulated time? </strong></h5>
									<div class="answer answer_601"><p>One of the biggest advantages in a Mutual Fund scheme is Liquidity, I.e. Ease of converting investment into cash.
Equity Linked Savings Schemes (ELSS), which offer tax benefits under Sec 80C, are required by regulation to 'lock-in' units for a period of 3 years, after which, they are free to be redeemed.
</p>
<p>There is another category of schemes popularly called as "Fixed Maturity Plans"(FMP's) where investors need to stay invested for a stipulated period which is pre-defined in the offer document of the scheme. These schemes have an investment duration of anywhere between three months to a few years.
</p>
<p>A few open end schemes may however, specify an exit load period. For instance, a scheme may specify that units redeemed with 6 months would attract an exit load of 0.50% at applicable NAV.
</p>
<p>One should bear in mind that while there be may some rules and regulations on minimum time horizon, it is best to take the advice of an investment advisor to know the appropriate or ideal time horizons for every type of schemes.

									<div class="answer answer_696"><p>The best part about Mutual Funds is that no matter what your financial goal is, you can find an appropriate scheme for it.
</p>
<p>So if you have a long term financial goal like planning for your retirement or your child's future education than equity funds could be a choice to consider
</p>
<p>If your endeavour is to potentially generate regular income, a fixed income fund could be considered.
</p>
<p>You may have suddenly received a windfall of money and are yet to decide where you wish to invest, you can consider a liquid fund. A liquid fund is a good substitute to consider for a savings account or even a current account to park your working capital.
</p>
<p>Mutual funds also offer investment options for saving tax. Equity Linked saving Schemes
(ELSS) are specifically designed to do the same.
Mutual Funds are a one-stop shop for practically all investment needs.</p>

<p>How do you decide what mode of transport you should take when you travel? Whether you want to walk it up, take an auto rickshaw, a train or a flight, it all depends on your destination, on your budget and travel time available.
</p>
<p>Planning for your financial goals is also uses the same kind of principles.
</p>
<p>Different modes of transport for different travel needs-different schemes (or combination of
schemes) for different needs. </p>
<p>
one may consider liquid funds for very short term needs, income funds for medium term
needs and equity funds (or a combination of different funds) for long term needs. Different
investors may invest in different schemes of the same asset category depending on the risk that
they are willing to take.</p>
<p>
Remember, there are solutions available among Mutual Funds for each investor need. It is
important to understand one's own unique need to find which solution is appropriate.

									<div class="answer answer_934">"My son is in the 9th grade. I am not sure what his interests are or what stream in education he should pursue. Should he go for Science, Commerce or Arts? Can someone help?" Many parents have such concerns. That is where one may approach an education, or a career, counselor, who has evaluated various options available for youngsters.
An investor seeking help to plan for achievement of financial goals would be in a similar position as the parent in the above case. The investor has access to so much information these days, it is mind-boggling. Getting intimidated or making mistakes are highly possible.
This is when an investment advisor or a Mutual Fund distributor is advisable.
They assess the financial situation of the investor and look at one's fmancial goals. Based on this, he or she would recommend various schemes to invest in. Now it is obvious that such a person would also need to understand a lot about the various Mutual Fund schemes and keep a regular watch both on the investor's situation as well as the various recommended schemes. Such an approach helps the investor achieve the financial goals through investments in Mutual Funds.

									<div class="answer answer_936"><p>In Mutual Funds, one often hears, 'more the nsk, more the return'. Is there truth in this? </p>
<p>If 'risk' is measured as either, probability of loss of capital or as swings and fluctuations in investment value, then asset classes like equity are undoubtedly the riskiest, and money in a savings bank account or in a government bond is of course least risky.
</p><p>In the Mutual Fund universe, a liquid fund is least risky and an equity fund is most risky.</p>
<p>So, the only reason to invest in equity would be an expectation of higher reward. However, higher returns come to those who invest in equity after careful study and adopting a patient, long term time horizon. In fact, risk in equity can be mitigated by adopting diversification as well having a longer term time horizon.
Every category of mutual fund schemes have different types of risks-credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, market/price risk, business risk, event risk, regulatory risk, etc. Your investment advisor and fund manager's expertise, and diversification, can help mitigate them.</p>

In a cricket match, the team batting second knows the equation how many runs, how many wickets and how many overs. It is very similar when it comes to investing for achievement of financial goals. Consider the financial goal as the target score. The amount you have accumulated so far is the runs you have scored so far.

									<div class="answer answer_691">Yes, it is "through" Mutual Funds and not "in" Mutual Funds. What is the difference? You may indulge in buying and selling stocks and bonds once in a while, but taking help from Mutual Funds to manage your investments may be a much better idea. When you invest through Mutual Funds, you invest in stocks, bonds or other investments indirectly with the help of professional managers. Instead of doing the tasks yourself, you pay a small fee and avail the services of a fund management company. These services include not just research, selection and buying-selling of various investments, for which a fund manager is well qualified, but also the accounting and administrative activities related to the task of investing, which many may not like to do themselves.

<p>But debt funds are of various types. </p>
<p>Like in banks, you can open a savings account, where you can put and remove money whenever you want. However, it doesn't make sense to keep money idle, tf you are not likely to use it for some time. You may, in such a case, open a fixed deposit-where the money is locked for a certain period allowing you to earn a higher rate of interest. You may also opt for a recurring deposit, wherein you keep investing a fixed amount every month for a pre-defined period of time. All these products help you with different requirements. </p>
<p>Similarly, among Mutual Funds too there are variants available in the debt fund category to fulfill various needs  of investors, like-Liquid Funds, Income Funds, Government Securities and Fixed Maturity Plans. </p>

									<div class="answer answer_581"><p>Once an investor has decided to invest in Mutual Funds, he has to make a decision of which scheme to invest in Fixed Income, Equity or Balanced and which Asset Management Company (AMC) to invest with? Firstly, discuss freely with your advisor what your objective is, what time period you're comfortable with, and what your risk appetite is. Decisions on which fund to invest in would be made based on this information.</p>
<p>1)	If you have a long term objective say, retirement planning, and are willing to assume some risk, then an Equity or Balanced Fund would be ideal.</p>
<p>2)	If you have a very short term objective say, money to be kept aside for a couple of months; a Liquid Fund would be ideal.</p>
<p>3)	If the idea is to generate regular income, then a Monthly Income Plan or an Income Fund would be recommended.</p>
<p>After deciding on the type of fund to invest in, a decision on the specific scheme from an AMC would have to be made. These decisions are usually made after ascertaining the AMC's track record, suitability of scheme, portfolio details, etc. Scheme Factsheets and Key Information Memorandum are two documents that every investor needs to peruse before investing. If one needs detailed information then one should look at Scheme Information Document. All of these are easily accessible at every Mutual Funds.</p>

									<div class="answer answer_594">That is where taking professional help counts. When one cannot do a particular job well be it lack of skills or time professionals serve the purpose. Mutual Funds offer such help. They also take the advantage of a large corpus to explore more opportunities simultaneously. Like a balanced diet we all need proteins, vitamins, carbohydrates, etc. Eating only one type results in some nutrient deficiency. Similarly, in a diversified equity fund you're exposed to different segments of the economy, and also protected from the potential downside.

									<div class="answer answer_587">The answer is a huge, resounding YES! It is important to note that experience in managing money/making investments plays a vital role in generating good performance. The more the experience, the better is the probability of making profitable investment decisions. The fund manager is similar to a surgeon in an operation theatre. Though it is the surgeon who actually does the critical operational procedure, he is assisted by assistant surgeons, anesthetists, nurses and other support staff. Similarly, the fund manager is assisted by the research team, junior fund managers and an operations team. Just as a surgeon has all the latest equipment to ensure a successful operation, the fund manager has access to the latest information, reports and analysis. An experienced fund manager would have seen many economic cycles, business developments, political and policy changes. Such issues have a bearing on investment performance. Since all these issues are normally beyond the grasp of an average investor, a fund manager brings not just their own expertise and competence, but also the collective wisdom from the information and data that he has access to.

									<div class="answer answer_586">There are different categories of mutual funds. How does one go about selecting which fund to invest? In fact, there are certain investment options available in the market that are promoted for certain age groups, e.g. savings schemes for senior citizens, children's funds and plans, etc. Does it mean that one should only go for such products and avoid everything else? Let us look at the same question differently. Well, it is important to understand why these special schemes are created. There are certain needs of people in a particular age group. These schemes are designed keeping the most common of such needs, e.g. funding higher education of kids when they reach college. However, some kids may have different needs, e.g. a prodigy may start a small business while studying, or there could be a child with special needs that have related expenses. The standard products may not satisfy these different needs and hence the investment plan might have to be completely different. It is not the age of the individual, but the different needs that matter while selecting the various mutual fund schemes.</div>

									<h5 class="text-green" data-ques="585"><strong>Are all Mutual Funds risky?</strong></h5>
									<div class="answer answer_585">Every investment we make involves a risk, only its nature and degree varies. The same applies to Mutual Funds too. All Mutual Fund schemes do not carry the same risk when it comes to returns on investment. Equity schemes have the potential to deliver superior returns over the long term that can create wealth. Remember, inflation is a risk, and equities are the best asset class to beat inflation. So, in a sense, there are some risks that are worth taking. On the other hand, the risk associated with liquid funds is significantly low when compared to equity funds. A liquid fund focuses on the protection of capital by taking lower risk and generating returns in line with the risk taken. It is also important to remember that the risk on returns is not the only risk you need to consider. There are other risks liquidity risk for instance. Liquidity risk measures the ease in converting your investment into cash. This risk is lowest in Mutual Funds. In the end, the nature and extent of risk is best understood through proper understanding and evaluation of the scheme and by taking the guidance of a Mutual Fund distributor or an investment advisor.

									<div class="answer answer_591">Every individual investor is unique. Not only with regards to investment objectives but even in approach and view of risk. This is what makes Risk Profiling absolutely crucial before investing.
<p>A Risk Profiler is essentially a questionnaire that seeks an investor's answers to questions about both "ability" and "willingness". </p>
<p>It is highly recommended that investors contact their Mutual Fund distributor or an investment advisor to complete this task and get to know their Risk Profile. </p>

									<div class="answer answer_590">With so many Mutual Funds schemes in the market, often one may wonder which scheme may be the best. But, understanding the meaning of "best" is more important. Often, people tend to select the "best" performers of a recent past period schemes that have delivered highest returns in the recent past. If you watch a movie filmed in the USA in December, you would notice people wearing warm overalls. Someone may really like it and want to have those. However, can you imagine someone wearing woollen clothes around the streets in Mumbai or Chennai? The same logic applies to Mutual Funds too. There is no such thing as the "best" Mutual Fund it is always about what is appropriate in a given situation and is in line with your investment objective. For long term goals there are different funds compared to short term needs. There are aggressive funds vastly different from moderate funds or even conservative funds. There are different funds for income generation as compared to wealth accumulation or for liquidity. So don't search for the best search for the most appropriate

<p>1)Equity or Growth Funds</p>
<p>· These invest predominantly in equities i.e. shares of companies </p>
<p>· The primary objective is wealth creation or capital appreciation. </p>
<p>· They have the potential to generate higher return and are best for long term investments. </p>
<p>· Examples would be </p>
<p>."Large Cap" funds which invest predominantly in companies that run large established business </p>
<p>."Mid Cap" funds which invest in mid-sized companies. </p>
<p>."Small Cap" funds that invest in small sized companies </p>
<p>."Multi Cap" funds that invest in a mix of large, mid and small sized companies. </p>
<p>."Sector"  funds that invest in companies that are related to one type of business. For e.g. Technology funds that invest only in technology companies </p>
<p>."Thematic" funds that invest in a common theme. For e.g. Infrastructure funds that invest in companies that will benefit from the growth in the infra structure segment · Tax-Saving Funds </p>
<p>2)Income or Bond or Fixed Income Funds </p>
<p>· These invest in Fixed Income Securities, like Government Securities or Bonds, Commercial Papers and Debentures, Bank Certificates of Deposits and Money Market instruments like Treasury Bills, Commercial Paper, etc. </p>
<p>· These are relatively safer investments and are suitable for both Capital Protection and Income Generation. </p>
<p>· Examples would be Liquid, Short Term, Floating Rate, Corporate Debt, Dynamic Bond, Gilt Funds, etc. </p>

									<div class="answer answer_593">Whether one invests ₹500 or ₹5 Crores. The, returns are the same. Confused?
<p>Not if you consider the returns on a percentage basis. For example, if a scheme has returns of 12% per annum, then an investment of ₹500 would grow to ₹1627.20 in two years. An investment of ₹100,000 in the same scheme would be ₹1,25,440 during the same period. While the rate of appreciation is the same in both cases, only the final amounts differ because of difference in initial investments. </p>
<p>We need to bear two things in mind here. Returns in percentage terms is the same for any amount invested. However, a larger amount invested at the start would result in larger absolute gains. </p>

<p>There are several ways to increase investments amounts as you go. In a mutual fund scheme, you can always make additional purchases in the same fund/account. In many fund houses, this can be for amounts as low as 100 or money can be transferred or switched in from other schemes. You can start a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP), which enables a regular investment into a scheme, much like a bank recurring deposit. Also, many AMCs allow their investors to increase their SIP contribution gradually every year, so as to account for an annual salary or income rise. Mutual Funds, with their flexibility and convenience are the ideal investment vehicles in today's busy world.</p>

								<h5 class="text-green" data-ques="680"><strong> Do Indian Mutual Funds invest only in India? </strong></h5>
								<div class="answer answer_680"><p>While most Indian Mutual Funds invest only in India, there are quite a few schemes that invest in overseas securities. </p>
<p>All Mutual Fund schemes need to get Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) approval before offering units to investors in India. SEBI gives an approval after scrutinising the Scheme Information Document (SID), which clearly spells out the scheme's investment objectives, type of securities to be invested in, countries and regions, and risks umque to each secunty. </p>
<p>There are in fact two ways for a scheme to get such exposure to foreign securities. Schemes may either buy such securities listed or traded in overseas exchanges, or they may invest in other overseas Mutual Fund schemes that have such securities in their portfolio after obtaining separate SEBI approval for investment in foreign securities. Either way, the scheme has foreign flavour in the portfolio.
</p><p>Even after investment in overseas securities, Indian Mutual Funds have to provide daily Net Asset Values, ensure portfolio disclosure, provide liquidity, etc. In short they have to comply with all SEBI regulations. Such schemes should have a dedicated separate fund manager for the investments in foreign securities component only.</p>

								<div class="answer answer_681"><p>Variety is the spice of life. At the same time, you do not seek variety just for the sake of it. Some variety is required simply because the situation demands it. So when you eat food, you've got to maintain balance. Food serves certain basic needs of the body-they offer vital nutrients. You need energy, you need stamina, you need strength, you need good eye sight-you get these from the vital nutrients-the fats, carbs, proteins, vitamins, etc. That food provides. At the same time, no single food items provides everything and hence you need varieties of food items in your daily meals. </p>
<p>In a similar manner, there are different Mutual Fund schemes for different purposes-to fulfill different needs of different investors. </p>
<p>Let us look at the basic requirements out of investments. An investor mainly needs a combination of four things: (1) safety of capital, (2) regular income, (3) liquidity, (4) growth of capital invested.

								<div class="answer answer_682"><p>Mutual Fund schemes investing in a single asset category are like specialist bowlers or batsmen. Whereas certain other schemes, known as hybrid funds, invest in more than one asset categories, e.g. some invest in equity and debt both. Some may also invest in gold apart from equity and debt. </p>
<p>In cricket, we see batting all-rounders as well as bowling all-rounders depending on the skill they are better at. Similarly, there are Mutual Fund schemes that invest heavily in one asset category as compared to another.
</p>
<p>The oldest category, the balanced fund category, invests in equity and debt. The allocation to equity is normally higher (over 65%) and the rest is in debt.
The other popular category known as MIP or the monthly income plan endeavours to provide monthly (or regular) income to investors. However, there is no guarantee of regular income. These schemes invest predominantly in debt securities so that regular income can be generated. A small portion is invested in equity to enhance returns over the years.
Another variation of the hybrid scheme invests in equity, debt and gold, to take advantage of three different asset classes in one portfolio.
An investor has an option of buying different equity or debt or gold fund schemes to create a hybrid portfolio or alternately buy a hybrid fund.</p>

When you go to a restaurant, you have a choice to order a la carte or buffet/thali or a full meal. Compare the full thali or the meal with a Mutual Fund, whereas individual items you order are the stocks, bonds, etc. A thali makes the choice easy, saves time and also some money. The important thing is to start early, even if small, and gradually add on to your investments as your earnings increase. This gives you better prospects of better returns in the long run.

								<h5 class="text-green" data-ques="589"><strong>What are the various ways to build wealth using mutual funds?</strong></h5>
								<div class="answer answer_589">As Benjamin Franklin said, "The way to wealth is as plain as the way to market. It depends chiefly on two words, industry and frugality." Today, modern business and commerce allow us to be wealthy through the ways in which we allocate our money. We can invest your money with those who are on the path to creating wealth. Or, we can be investors in businesses of entrepreneurs, by investing in stocks of various companies. As the entrepreneurs and the managers run their businesses efficiently and profitably, the shareholders get the benefits. In this regard, Mutual Funds are a great way to build wealth. However, we all know that investing in stocks can be risky some companies do not survive for long, some companies' stock prices fluctuate too much, etc.</div>

								<h5 class="text-green" data-ques="684"><strong>What are the various type of debt funds? </strong></h5>
								<div class="answer answer_684"><p>Debt funds are for investors who seek safety of capital or regular income from investment and/or want to park money for short periods.
But debt funds are of various types. </p>
<p>Like in banks, you can open a savings account, where you can put and remove money whenever you want. However, it doesn't make sense to keep money idle, tf you are not likely to use it for some time. You may, in such a case, open a fixed deposit-where the money is locked for a certain period allowing you to earn a higher rate of interest. You may also opt for a recurring deposit, wherein you keep investing a fixed amount every month for a pre-defined period of time. All these products help you with different requirements. </p>
<p>Similarly, among Mutual Funds too there are variants available in the debt fund category to fulfill various needs  of investors, like-Liquid Funds, Income Funds, Government Securities and Fixed Maturity Plans.
An investor would be advised to select schemes based on one's unique requirements. </p>

								<h5 class="text-green" data-ques="685"><strong>Won't I need a large amount to invest in Mutual Funds? </strong></h5>
								<div class="answer answer_685"><p>People think that Mutual Funds are elite investments made only for the wealthy. The fact is: one does not need  large sum to invest in Mutual Funds, you can start with a sum as low as 500, or 5000 depending on the kind of fund you choose. </p>
<p>Why keep the minimum amounts as low as these? </p>

<p>The economies of scale can be understood easily if we look at travelling by an airplane. The plane would cost a lot of money and, of course, not everybody owns a plane! However, we can afford air travel simply because all the costs are divided among all the passengers using the services at various different points of time. </p>
<p>Similarly, a person may not have enough money to create a diversified portfolio through investment in a very large number of investment avenues, one may not have enough money required to conduct or purchase research on investments. However, the economies of scale allow small investors to get multiple benefits through Mutual Funds.
Mutual Funds are thus ideal vehicles for small investors for saving and investing.

								<h5 class="text-green" data-ques="686"><strong>How long does one need to stay invested in a Mutual Fund? </strong></h5>
								<div class="answer answer_686"><p>One of the most important considerations before choosing an investment avenue is the expected" time horizon", i.e. Time in days, months or years that an investor intends to stay invested. </p>
<p>And why is this so important? </p>
<p>All investments should ideally result from a financial or investment plan. Such plans usually indicate how long it would take for a financial objective to be met.
Let's consider an investor who Just made 150 tacs in a real estate transaction. He is looking for a safe avenue to invest, before he takes a final decision on what to do with that money. An ideal scheme in this case would be a Liquid Fund, which is designed to provide liquidity with generally a high probability for capital protection. He can redeem whenever he has made up his mind.

								<h5 class="text-green" data-ques="687"><strong>Who keeps a record of my investments? </strong></h5>
								<div class="answer answer_687">All Mutual Funds in India are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). Mutual Fund regulations clearly define the roles and responsibilities of Asset Management Companies (AMC) and Custodians. It's vital to remember that every investor has to complete an effective KYC process before investing. Therefore, only bonafide investors with a valid PAN card can invest in Mutual Fund schemes. Such investors also provide bank details so that all redemption proceeds are directly credited to an investors own account.
<p>EBI also ensures that all AMCs are supervised by a board of trustees, some of whom, have to necessarily be independent individuals. These trustees ensure one more level of safeguards and compliance. </p>
<p>Regulations and safeguards ensure that it can never ever be misappropriated and diverted, and that, no one will run with your money.</p>

								<h5 class="text-green" data-ques="688"><strong>How do I withdraw my money from Mutual Funds?  </strong></h5>
								<div class="answer answer_688">One of the biggest advantages of Mutual Funds is liquidity-the ease of converting an investor's units into cash. </p>
<p>Mutual Funds, being regulated by Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), have well laid out norms to ensure liquidity. Open end schemes, which comprise of a large majority of schemes, offer liquidity as a major feature. Liquidity is ease of access or conversion of an asset into cash.  </p>
<p>Once the redemption is complete, funds are transferred to the designated bank account of the investor, within 3 business days after the redemption was lodged.
However two issues need to be kept in mind. One, there may be an exit load period in certain schemes. In such cases, redemptions before a certain specified period, say 3 months, may attract a nominal load like 0.5% of Asset Value. Fund Managers impose such loads to deter short term investors. Secondly, AMCs may indicate what the minimum amount for redemption is. Investors are advised to read all scheme related documents carefully before investing

								<div class="answer answer_671"><p>"Mutual Funds could be a good saving tool for short term."
"You must be patient with your Mutual Fund investments. It takes time to deliver results."
People regularly come across both the above statements, which are clearly contradictory. </p>
<p>So what period are Mutual Funds suitable for?Short term or long term?</p>

<p>Well, that depends on what one's investment goals are, and most goals are driven by time. There are schemes suitable for short periods, there are several schemes suitable for longer horizon, and then, there are schemes for any period in-between. </p>
<p>Consult your Mutual Fund distributor or your investment advisor, discuss your financial goals, and then decide where you want to invest. For example, </p>
<p>1) Equity-oriented Mutual Funds-Look for longer periods, typrcally 5 years and above. </p>
<p>2) Fixed Income oriented Mutual Funds- </p>
<p>1) Liquid Funds-For very short term-Less than 1 year .</p>
<p>2) Short Term Bond Funds-For the medium term-1 to 3 years. </p>
<p>3) Long Term Bond Funds-For the long term-3 years or more </p>
